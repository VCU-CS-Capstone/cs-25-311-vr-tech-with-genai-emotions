## *Project Description*
Advancing content creation and development in virtual reality (VR) environments through the integration of generative AI, facial recognition, and emotion recognition technologies. This project, in collaboration with the School of the Arts and Korea Arts, aims to enhance user experiences by leveraging AI to not only generate immersive and dynamic content but also to personalize interactions based on users' emotional responses. By utilizing facial recognition, the system can accurately track and analyze facial expressions, allowing emotion recognition algorithms to adjust VR experiences in real-time, creating a more interactive, adaptive, and emotionally resonant virtual environment.
